### Step 1: Set Up Your School Calendar

- Holidays
- Breaks

**Why:** The system uses this to calculate actual week dates when assigning templates.

### Step 2: Create Week Templates
📍 **Go to:** Templates (top nav) or Dashboard → "Create Template"

**Create 9 templates** (one for each week of the quarter):
- Template Name: "Week 1 - Ancient Rome", "Week 2 - Roman Republic", etc.
- Grade Level: (optional) e.g., "6"
- Unit: (optional) e.g., "Ancient Civilizations"
- Subject: ELA, Science, or History
- Then add all content:
  - Day 1: Vocabulary & Affixes
  - Day 2: Weekly Passage & Literal Questions
  - Day 4: Main Idea Questions
  - Day 5: Friday Passage & Assessment

**Result:** You now have 9 reusable lesson plans

### Step 3: Import or Add Students
📍 **Go to:** Students (top nav) or Dashboard → "Manage Students"

**Options:**
- Import from Google Classroom
- Manually add students

---

### Step 4: Assign Templates to Students
📍 **Go to:** Assignments (top nav) or Dashboard → "Assign to Students"

**For each student:**
1. Select the student
2. Choose quarter (1-4)
3. Choose week number (1-9)
4. Select which template to assign
5. Click "Assign Template"

**Repeat 9 times** for each student (one for each week)
