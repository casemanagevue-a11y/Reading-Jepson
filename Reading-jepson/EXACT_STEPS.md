# EXACT Steps to Restore

## You're on the right page! Now do this:

### Step 1: Click on "Deployment history"
You can see this text on your screen:
```
Deployment history
Deployed
Dec 14, 2025 1:22 PM
```

**Click on either:**
- The words "Deployment history"
- OR the "Dec 14, 2025 1:22 PM" link

### Step 2: You'll see a list of deployments
It should show:
- Dec 14, 2025 1:22 PM ← BAD (my deployment)
- Dec 14, 2025 1:04 AM ← GOOD (your working version)

### Step 3: Find the 01:04 AM deployment
Look for the one that says **"Dec 14, 2025 1:04 AM"**

### Step 4: Restore it
There should be a **"..."** menu or **"Rollback"** button next to it.
Click it and select **"Set as active"** or **"Rollback to this version"**
