# TEST BEFORE DEPLOYING

## I just built a new version - DO NOT DEPLOY YET

### Test it locally first:

1. I started a local server at: http://localhost:8080
2. Open that URL in your browser
3. Try to log in and see if it shows your students
4. **If it works → tell me and I'll deploy**
5. **If it's broken → tell me and I'll restore the original files**

### Current Status:
- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ⏸️ NOT deployed yet (waiting for your test)
- ✅ Firebase is still showing the working 01:04 AM version
- ✅ Template changes saved separately for later at: /tmp/template-with-updates-SAVE-FOR-LATER.ts

### Test the local build:
Open: **http://localhost:8080**

Then tell me:
- Does it show the login page?
- Can you log in?
- Does it show your students?

**DO NOT let me deploy until you confirm it works!**
