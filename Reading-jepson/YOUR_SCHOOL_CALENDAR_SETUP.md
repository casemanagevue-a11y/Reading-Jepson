- **Q2:** October 13 - December 19
- **Q3:** January 5 - March 13

### Short Weeks to Plan For

Based on your calendar, these weeks will need **shorter templates**:

#### Quarter 1
- **Week 1** (Aug 14-15): Only 2 days → Use **3-day template** (plan Days 1-3)
- **Week 4** (Sept 1-5): Labor Day Mon → Use **4-day template** 
- **Week 9** (Oct 7-10): Ends Thu → Use **4-day template**

#### Quarter 2
- **Week 4** (Nov 10-14): School Holiday → Use **4-day template**
- **Week 6** (Nov 24-28): Thanksgiving all week → **Skip** or use **3-day template**

#### Quarter 3
- **Week 1** (Jan 5-9): Minimum Day Mon → Use **5-day** (but note short Friday)
- **Week 3** (Jan 19-23): MLK Day Mon → Use **4-day template**
- **Week 7** (Feb 16-20): President's Break all week → **Skip week**

#### Quarter 4

## Template Strategy

### Create These Template Sets

#### Full Weeks (5 days)
Create 20-25 templates for normal weeks:
- Days 1-5 fully planned
- All passages and activities

#### Short Weeks (4 days)
Create 8-10 templates for 4-day weeks:
- Days 1-4 only
- Condensed activities
- Skip Friday assessment OR move to Day 4

#### Very Short Weeks (3 days)
Create 4-5 templates for 3-day weeks:
- Days 1-3 only
- Essential content only
- Focus on vocabulary + one passage

## Assignment Workflow

### For Each Student (Per Quarter)

1. **Identify which weeks are short** based on calendar
2. **Assign appropriate templates:**
   - Regular weeks → 5-day template
   - Holiday weeks → 4-day template
   - Break weeks → 3-day template or skip
3. **Result:** Each student has 7-9 assignments (some quarters have fewer due to breaks)

### Example: Quarter 2 Assignments

Student: Ryan Davis
- Week 1: "Q2 Week 1 - Theme" (5-day) → Oct 13-17
- Week 2: "Q2 Week 2 - Character" (5-day) → Oct 20-24
- Week 3: "Q2 Week 3 - Setting" (5-day) → Oct 27-31
- Week 4: "Q2 Week 4 - Short" (4-day) → Nov 3-7 (holiday Thu)
- Week 5: "Q2 Week 5 - Plot" (5-day) → Nov 10-14
- Week 6: SKIP (Thanksgiving)
- Week 7: "Q2 Week 7 - Conflict" (5-day) → Dec 1-5
- Week 8: "Q2 Week 8 - Review" (5-day) → Dec 8-12
- Week 9: "Q2 Week 9 - Assessment" (4-day) → Dec 15-19

**Total: 8 assignments (skipped Week 6)**

## Handling Minimum Days (Every Friday)

### Option 1: Ignore
- Your Friday assessments already account for shorter time
- No changes needed to templates

### Option 2: Track for Planning
- Add all Friday minimum days to calendar
- Mark as "Minimum Day" type
- Use for reference when planning activities

### Option 3: Adjust Friday Content
- Create templates with lighter Friday assessments
- Note: System doesn't enforce timing, just provides structure

**Recommendation:** Option 1 (ignore) - your current lesson plans already work with Friday's schedule
